In this case we force no one. \nOr we force them, but only for a short military service (a couple of months at most.)."

(the company still recommends limiting it to 110km/h to preserve the engine)\nSimple yet not simplistic, the car interior is as colorful as the exterior and Renault maintained their promise of ergonomy, since a few adjustements can be made for either a Pony or a Griffon to use this car as well.\nRenault promised the car would be affordable for even a factory worker, easy to maintain and to build.

 europe.4130.d:0 "As the shadow of war approaches again, our army must get to know this world's armies.\nThanks to our good relation with Equestrians, we could make an exercise alongside their army to get to know each others' strengths and weaknesses, the rapid of deployment of our army, a small reminder to how we used to deploy in case of a conventional conflict back home."

Two fighters squadrons, and Helicopters.\nThe exercise took place near Tall tales and the Ponyville training fields.\n\nOur soldiers showed all their expertise and professionalism in this exercise. Our equipment was indeed very effective in the hands of those veterans, but the Equestrian proved more than capable although a bit clumsy in their manoeuvres.\nThestral and Pegasus proved a problem for our soldiers, surprising them more than once. Our soldiers were also surprised by the Equestrian use of magic on the battlefield.\n\nAll in all, the four weeks long exercise proved very instructional for both side and manoeuvres exercise showed that bilateral cooperation was good for the high command. Both sides expressed their wish to continue training alongside."

 europe.4150.d:0 "Today took place the ceremonial parade after the end of the international exercise Sapphire [GetYear].\n\nWhile our army is in full restructuration and modernisation, we managed to get some units to join the exercise, some armoured units, the Instructional units of Ponyville and Tales, and 2 Infantry division flanked by independent Pegasus and Thestral battalion.\nOur command clearly had problems regrouping units into fighting formation, the Europeans on the other hands quickly engaged combat with some of their most nimble units. Good thing is that they were not acquainted with the fighting capabilities of some of our species. Pegasus, Batponies and Unicorns.\nOur Earth ponies did their job correctly, but the more modern equipment of the human infantry proved decisive in some engagement.\n\nRecon tactics and electronic warfare particularly impressed our high command. NCO were more interested in the general equipment of our new friend. Some technician are already working on blueprints for new APC.\n\nAll in all, the four weeks long exercise proved very instructional for both side and manoeuvres exercise showed that bilateral cooperation was good for the high command. Both sides expressed their wish to continue training alongside."

The population is quite friendly to our implementation but fear that we might begin to exploit their resources and erase their cultures.\n\nOur ministry is planning to send a lot of our population on the channel to make some place on the peninsula.\nSome environmentalists are arguing that sending too many of our citizens might disturb the nature in the region."

The Lunarists entrenched themselves in fox-holes to ambush us and often attacked us at night.\n\nThe most violent fighting took place on the Lesnoye-Albion line where we lost a lot of soldiers. After several days, Lesnoye fell after one combined assault by the 4th Alpine and 1st Manehatten regiments. Soon after the Lunarist commander and ours met in Albion and agreed to let the Lunarist forces leave the eastern coast.\n\nPonies in the region rejoice but... At what cost for us?"
