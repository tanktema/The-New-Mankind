After radio confirmation, the soldiers led several blindfolded ponies out and quickly led them to one of the barracks before the convoy left the base and disappeared into the night.\nFive minutes later, the ponies and the human scientists were already sitting around a table. The silence wasn't long:\n-Welcome to the Supernova Project lab. My name is Robert Oppenheimer, I'm a nuclear physicist. You probably haven't been introduced to each other, so if you'll excuse me, I'll start with this. So, Mr. Marcus from Barrad, energy flow specialist, Otom Freeze from Equestria, transfiguration specialist, and Mist Snow, soul magic specialist from Waterlands - let's get acquainted. Do you know why we're all here?\n-No, we don't - the Equestrian mage said - All I know is that it has something to do with Daybreaker.\n-Exactly. We are trying to reverse transformation and turn Daybreaker back into Celestia\n-Impossible! - Marcus exclaimed - Do you have any idea of the power that Daybreaker has? She'll just ignore any spell!\n-What about Caduceus? - Mist suddenly asked. - Caduceus acts on the soul\n-t's not that simple,- Markus countered. - Yes, Caduceus can separate one personality from another, but do you have any idea how much energy that takes? The power of all the mages in Barrad would barely be enough!\n-Is there any way to turn thermal energy into magical energy? - Oppenheimer asked quietly\n-just give me a moment... Yes, yes, there is a spell like that, but where are we going to get that much energy?\n-Here's the answer - Oppenheimer said, - just take this pill first\n-What is it? \n-A radio-protector.\nThey took one each, then men put on some strange suits, and then two soldiers carefully brought in an oblong box \n-it was a PC-150 thermonuclear warhead. It was meant to be launched from a Trinity-class battleship. One of those missiles would wipe out Manehattan, a dozen of them would turn the entire River Coalition to dust. We've got five of them. Is that enough?"

    uns_supernova.3.desc:0 "Oppenheimer had been sitting at his calculating papers for three days. It seemed only yesterday that he had begun to map out a machine capable of performing the single function of projecting a spell as powerful as the world had ever seen. If it were not for the help of the leading mages, it seemed that the scientist had no chance at all. In fact, how do you create a machine whose main purpose is to absorb 10 megatons in TNT equivalent in moments and turn them into magical energy, and then direct it into a focusing machine, charged with a matrix with a single spell? Oppenheimer leaned back in his chair tiredly and rubbed his temples:\n-At this rate, we'll be here for six months... We don't have six months!  No problem with energy absorption, thanks to the shield magic. But what about transformation? We're missing something, but I can't figure out what...\n-That's not surprising - replied Sky Star, a mage scholar from Washington - Projects like this were never even conceived, let alone implemented. After all, no one would have guessed that the legend would turn out to be true..\n-Legend?\n-The Legend of the Daybreaker. Legend has it that Celestia has been accumulating anger and rage for all her life, only to one day unleash it all upon herself...\n-I'll have to read it... Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait... What did you say? Have been accumulating her anger and rage?\n-Well... yeah, according to legend - Sky Star replied uncertainly.?\nAfter these words, Oppenheimer quickly grabbed a pencil and began scribbling something on the paper, muttering some numbers. Ten minutes later he threw the pencil on the table, jumped up from his chair, picked up Sky Star, and hugged her tightly\n-This is it! The accumulators! Crystals are great stores of magical energy! Why do we need to transfer all the energy at once if we can first store it in crystals and then pump it into the installation? The system would be more stable, the energy supply would increase, and most importantly, we would have more crystals! Well done!!\n-Thank you, sir - Skye Star said embarrassed - But it's not like I did anything....\n-What do you mean by 'Didn't do anything'?!"

Despite the curfew, the Solar Guard would not touch him, first, because he had diplomatic immunity, and second, after he'd literally stomped two drunken lieutenants into the dirt, they wouldn't mess with him. The largest library in the world-and the only one guarded at Fort Knox level. Solar Guard patrols swarmed around the library, sentries at the entrance wore heavy armor, and snipers stationed in the surrounding houses were uncountable. Still, the captain found a loophole. He had ten seconds to get into the library, and fifteen minutes to find Senior Transfiguration spells. At least he had a diagram of the library, which made the task a little easier. The captain carefully slipped past the patrol, waited for the sniper to change sectors and the patrol to disappear around the corner, and carefully climbed through the window that the janitor, a member of the Resistance, had intentionally left open. Once inside and quickly reaching the section on transfiguration spells, the Captain allowed himself a little distraction to think while he looked for the right book\nThe Captain himself could not answer why he agreed to this adventure without a second thought. When the messenger from his old friend Shepard arrived in Moscow, Serpov was training recruits. However, without hesitation he agreed to help an old friend.\n-Old Prima Donna, Natural Disguise, Dendromutagenics... Aha, there it is! Senior Transfiguration. Good, time to go. \nNot so fast, human.- He turned around and saw the janitor lying tied up against the wall with a guard standing in front of him with a magical rifle in his chest.\n -You are a fool, human. You will all fall for the glory of the Emp...\nhe did not have time to speak. The captain was making sense: the stallion had broken the first rule of combat, and he had lost. He ducked under the barrel and with a knee strike to the muzzle, the captain knocked the guard to the floor before knocking the rifle aside and pulling out a knife\nYou speak too much, but I have little time\nSaying that, the captain struck a blow to the throat, grabbed a book from the shelf and, cutting through the janitor's bonds, quickly ran to the exit."

When Sunrise Sparkle and her escort stepped into the grounds, two more soldiers jumped in. \n-No law enforcement or military personnel are allowed on Embassy grounds unless instructed to do so. \nShe smirked and magically took out a piece of paper from her bag. \nAccording to decree 5 of January 5th year 1 AER, the Lady Inquisitor's Praetorian Guards are not law enforcement or military personnel, so they will come with me.\n Colonel Stabber read the document and, finding no errors, nodded briefly to the soldiers\"If the guards disappeared with her, it would be easier for us to justify ourselves.\" he thought.\nThe Inquisitor entered the embassy building and addressed the clerk\n - I have an appointment with the General.

Everything looked rather standard: no guards, no \"waiting for orders\" squads, only a small patrol walking around the floor. Satisfied with what she saw, Sparkle entered the office. Shepard was already seated at his desk. At the sound of the door opening, he looked up:\nGood afternoon, Lady Inquisitor. I'm glad you accepted my invitation. Come, sit down.\n-When I received your letter, I thought it might be a trap. \n-It has come to my attention that your guards have detained one of our officers who attempted to breach the library. Since all officers in our army report to me, I'd like you to hand him over to us. We'll deal with him ourselves. \n-We'll hand him over to you... If you answer one question for me.

You don't stand a chance! How do you plan on doing that? \n-The Caduceus spell, the Senior Transfiguration, and an incredible amount of magical energy. \n-And where are you going to find that much energy? Maybe you have four Alicorns? \b-No, but we have five warheads, each of which could wipe out Mainhattan or Canterlot, and a thermal-to-magic energy converter.\nThe laughter stopped abruptly.
