After radio confirmation, the soldiers led several blindfolded ponies out and quickly led them to one of the barracks before the convoy left the base and disappeared into the night.\nFive minutes later, the ponies and the human scientists were already sitting around a table. The silence wasn't long:\n-Welcome to the Supernova Project lab. My name is Robert Oppenheimer, I'm a nuclear physicist. You probably haven't been introduced to each other, so if you'll excuse me, I'll start with this. So, Mr. Marcus from Barrad, energy flow specialist, Otom Freeze from Equestria, transfiguration specialist, and Mist Snow, soul magic specialist from Waterlands - let's get acquainted. Do you know why we're all here?\n-No, we don't - the Equestrian mage said - All I know is that it has something to do with Daybreaker.\n-Exactly. We are trying to reverse transformation and turn Daybreaker back into Celestia\n-Impossible! - Marcus exclaimed - Do you have any idea of the power that Daybreaker has? She'll just ignore any spell!\n-What about Caduceus? - Mist suddenly asked. - Caduceus acts on the soul\n-t's not that simple,- Markus countered. - Yes, Caduceus can separate one personality from another, but do you have any idea how much energy that takes? The power of all the mages in Barrad would barely be enough!\n-Is there any way to turn thermal energy into magical energy? - Oppenheimer asked quietly\n-just give me a moment... Yes, yes, there is a spell like that, but where are we going to get that much energy?\n-Here's the answer - Oppenheimer said, - just take this pill first\n-What is it? \n-A radio-protector.\nThey took one each, then men put on some strange suits, and then two soldiers carefully brought in an oblong box \n-it was a PC-150 thermonuclear warhead. It was meant to be launched from a Trinity-class battleship. One of those missiles would wipe out Manehattan, a dozen of them would turn the entire River Coalition to dust. We've got five of them. Is that enough?"

    uns_supernova.3.desc:0 "Oppenheimer had been sitting at his calculating papers for three days. It seemed only yesterday that he had begun to map out a machine capable of performing the single function of projecting a spell as powerful as the world had ever seen. If it were not for the help of the leading mages, it seemed that the scientist had no chance at all. In fact, how do you create a machine whose main purpose is to absorb 10 megatons in TNT equivalent in moments and turn them into magical energy, and then direct it into a focusing machine, charged with a matrix with a single spell? Oppenheimer leaned back in his chair tiredly and rubbed his temples:\n-At this rate, we'll be here for six months... We don't have six months!  No problem with energy absorption, thanks to the shield magic. But what about transformation? We're missing something, but I can't figure out what...\n-That's not surprising - replied Sky Star, a mage scholar from Washington - Projects like this were never even conceived, let alone implemented. After all, no one would have guessed that the legend would turn out to be true..\n-Legend?\n-The Legend of the Daybreaker. Legend has it that Celestia has been accumulating anger and rage for all her life, only to one day unleash it all upon herself...\n-I'll have to read it... Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait... What did you say? Have been accumulating her anger and rage?\n-Well... yeah, according to legend - Sky Star replied uncertainly.?\nAfter these words, Oppenheimer quickly grabbed a pencil and began scribbling something on the paper, muttering some numbers. Ten minutes later he threw the pencil on the table, jumped up from his chair, picked up Sky Star, and hugged her tightly\n-This is it! The accumulators! Crystals are great stores of magical energy! Why do we need to transfer all the energy at once if we can first store it in crystals and then pump it into the installation? The system would be more stable, the energy supply would increase, and most importantly, we would have more crystals! Well done!!\n-Thank you, sir - Skye Star said embarrassed - But it's not like I did anything....\n-What do you mean by 'Didn't do anything'?!"

Despite the curfew, the Solar Guard would not touch him, first, because he had diplomatic immunity, and second, after he'd literally stomped two drunken lieutenants into the dirt, they wouldn't mess with him. The largest library in the world-and the only one guarded at Fort Knox level. Solar Guard patrols swarmed around the library, sentries at the entrance wore heavy armor, and snipers stationed in the surrounding houses were uncountable. Still, the captain found a loophole. He had ten seconds to get into the library, and fifteen minutes to find Senior Transfiguration spells. At least he had a diagram of the library, which made the task a little easier. The captain carefully slipped past the patrol, waited for the sniper to change sectors and the patrol to disappear around the corner, and carefully climbed through the window that the janitor, a member of the Resistance, had intentionally left open. Once inside and quickly reaching the section on transfiguration spells, the Captain allowed himself a little distraction to think while he looked for the right book\nThe Captain himself could not answer why he agreed to this adventure without a second thought. When the messenger from his old friend Shepard arrived in Moscow, Serpov was training recruits. However, without hesitation he agreed to help an old friend.\n-Old Prima Donna, Natural Disguise, Dendromutagenics... Aha, there it is! Senior Transfiguration. Good, time to go. \nNot so fast, human.- He turned around and saw the janitor lying tied up against the wall with a guard standing in front of him with a magical rifle in his chest.\n -You are a fool, human. You will all fall for the glory of the Emp...\nhe did not have time to speak. The captain was making sense: the stallion had broken the first rule of combat, and he had lost. He ducked under the barrel and with a knee strike to the muzzle, the captain knocked the guard to the floor before knocking the rifle aside and pulling out a knife\nYou speak too much, but I have little time\nSaying that, the captain struck a blow to the throat, grabbed a book from the shelf and, cutting through the janitor's bonds, quickly ran to the exit."

When Sunrise Sparkle and her escort stepped into the grounds, two more soldiers jumped in. \n-No law enforcement or military personnel are allowed on Embassy grounds unless instructed to do so. \nShe smirked and magically took out a piece of paper from her bag. \nAccording to decree 5 of January 5th year 1 AER, the Lady Inquisitor's Praetorian Guards are not law enforcement or military personnel, so they will come with me.\n Colonel Stabber read the document and, finding no errors, nodded briefly to the soldiers\"If the guards disappeared with her, it would be easier for us to justify ourselves.\" he thought.\nThe Inquisitor entered the embassy building and addressed the clerk\n - I have an appointment with the General.

Everything looked rather standard: no guards, no \"waiting for orders\" squads, only a small patrol walking around the floor. Satisfied with what she saw, Sparkle entered the office. Shepard was already seated at his desk. At the sound of the door opening, he looked up:\nGood afternoon, Lady Inquisitor. I'm glad you accepted my invitation. Come, sit down.\n-When I received your letter, I thought it might be a trap. \n-It has come to my attention that your guards have detained one of our officers who attempted to breach the library. Since all officers in our army report to me, I'd like you to hand him over to us. We'll deal with him ourselves. \n-We'll hand him over to you... If you answer one question for me.

You don't stand a chance! How do you plan on doing that? \n-The Caduceus spell, the Senior Transfiguration, and an incredible amount of magical energy. \n-And where are you going to find that much energy? Maybe you have four Alicorns? \b-No, but we have five warheads, each of which could wipe out Mainhattan or Canterlot, and a thermal-to-magic energy converter.\nThe laughter stopped abruptly.

Looking toward the Germans, the sergeant noticed that one soldier had also raised his binoculars, and was now examining him...\nWith fear in his chest, Andersen slowly climbed out of his foxhole with his hands raised, and, ignoring the calls of his comrades, walked toward the German trenches. From there another soldier climbed out and walked toward him. Meeting on no man's land, the soldiers stood staring at each other for a few minutes before suddenly laughing and shaking hands. Seeing this, some soldiers on both sides crawled out of the trenches in exactly the same way and approached each other. Just as their fathers had done years before, they laughed, joked, celebrated Christmas, exchanged small gifts. As the crowd of human soldiers mingled with the ponies and changelings, things became even more fun: the games the humans were trying to play proved to be quite amusing from the pony's point of view, and the stories and jokes overlapped in many ways. There was music, songs, laughter, and cheers all around... In all this merriment, neither the ponies nor the changlings nor the young human soldiers noticed one thing: the sadness and despair in the eyes of their older comrades. Sergeant Andersen looked at the same German who first came out to them, and saw in his eyes the same bitterness that he carefully hid inside him. Unable to watch without tears, the British soldier turned his gaze to the object he held in his hand. On it, dirty with blood, dirt, and soot, lay a round brass medallion, with a photograph embedded inside: a British soldier embraced a German soldier, lowering his rifles and exchanging hats, while behind them stood a small farmhouse that had only miraculously survived shelling and air raids. Turning the medal over, not holding back his tears and wiping them furtively, the soldier read the inscription engraved by his father after his return from the front: \"The War to end all Wars\". Pressing the medallion to his chest, the sergeant whispered:"

    af_gem.2.desc:0 "The Kriegsmarine cruiser, a miracle survivor of the war, had been advancing through the far north for weeks. Wilhelm Strasse, sitting in his cabin, and occasionally giving commands, continued to read a strange folio found in the bowels of New Berlin. It was written in a language that resembled Latin - fortunately, Wilhelm was very fond of that language, and considered it truly Germanic, so there was no particular problem. The entries reflected in the book were delightfully terrifying and incredibly stunning, and the diagrams and formulas given were incredibly difficult to describe...\nStrasse was in the process of studying another page of the book when an adjutant knocked on the door and informed him that they were arriving. Wilhelm quickly slammed the book shut, and grabbed it and went to the bridge. From the window, he looked out over the Magehold, over the lands of the League of Terror. Black earth, desiccated trees and bushes, incomprehensible monsters... Finally, in this cycle of fear and death, they found a small... city? Village? Something incomprehensible. The landing craft docked at the shore, and the soldiers were immediately attacked by incomprehensible creatures. However, the soldiers, loyal to Strassa, were ready, and within minutes the creatures were destroyed. Soon, however, they began to rise, and their wounds began to heal. There was no doubt: Strasse had found what he was looking for. After giving the order to find whoever was controlling the creatures, Strasse stepped off the bridge and went to the cargo bay. Halfway there, he was informed that soldiers had captured a changeling-like creature and were taking it to the ship. Upon receiving this information, Strasse approached the two sarcophagi in the cargo hold with a terrifying smile on his face and whispered:\n-Soon... very soon..."

Oh, how long he had waited for this day: Himmler shouting at him that he had put soldiers' lives at risk, Goebbels angry that people were afraid of this League invasion, Ulbricht and Brandt condemning the invasion of foreign lands... Suddenly the soldiers, who had been standing at the entrance to the office, left the office, and Strasse, applauding, rose from his seat:\n-You call me a madman and a monster. You want me dead. And you want answers. Well, you won't see me dead, you'll get answers soon enough... And as for the monster, I'm not a monster. I am General Wilhelm Strasse, known as Skull, and you wretched worms are not worth my spit. Neither mine nor his...\Now the door swung open and four soldiers in black uniforms and armor walked in. The next to come through the door was the one who made the whole military council scream in horror at the sight of him. Ignoring their screams, William Blaskowitz, the dead American saboteur, drew his pistol and shot Ulbricht and Brandt, then pointed it at Himmler, saying, "Heil Hitler! The soldiers answered him, and another man entered the door, at the sight of whom Himmler fainted and Goebbels, in a trembling voice, said, "Heil Hitler! My Führer, is it really you?.."

It was not even finished, the speeches of congressmen and senators were interrupted by the sound of working instruments, but this should not have stopped the work of the government. Today, the political elite of good old America were considering the controversial question of the so-called Emperor. Rumors and scattered confirmations from the New Washington Police Department reported large units of unknown armed forces that did not clash with members of the law or ordinary citizens. The armed men did not enter the city itself, but methodically surrounded it on all sides. But the General Staff was silent, as if they had had enough water in their mouths, and even the mobilized National Guard was in no hurry to move towards the strange insurgents. \n-I urge everyone to calm down, calm down! - Senator Rockwell shouted, tapping the podium with his palm. - We'll get to the bottom of this, but by God, I'm pretty sure it's the Reds! \n-The Communists are too far away from us, and they've got the typical food problems, - said a skeptical voice. \nRockwell glanced angrily around the room, but never saw the man who'd interrupted him. The man adjusted his tie and cleared his throat before continuing. \n-Russians, of course, are far away. But some of our fellow citizens have fallen under the crippling influence of the Commies, too. Mr. McCarthy has irrefutable evidence of Marxist circles even in the state government! - The senator nodded toward his running mate, to the whispers of the other senators. - One can assume that this emperor is nothing more than the leader of a communist cell. \n- Not an appropriate nickname for a Communist leader, - came the same voice of disbelief. \n-It's designed to confuse us! The Commies aren't as dumb as the propaganda makes them out to be; they've taken over nearly half of our old Earth! Idiots can't do that. As for the reports about the alleged alien origin of these anarchist terrorists - I can advise such people to read less fiction."

Two of them resembled knights of the past, wearing gilded armor, tall helmets with bright red plumes, and intricate ornaments and patterns. They differed from the knights in their truly gigantic stature-even the tallest Senator Milton, at six and a half feet tall, was probably only as tall as the chest of the knights. They were led by a man who might have been mistaken for an actor in the now popular peplum, the classic Roman garb. A white toga with a purple stripe, sandals... The man's skin was dark but not quite black, a golden laurel wreath rested on his head, and it looked as if he had a real halo shining over his head! \n-Who let the nigger in here? - was all Rockwell had to say. The next moment the \"Roman\" who entered raised his hand, the senator standing at the podium ceased to exist. As if by magic, the U.S. politician crumbled into ashes, and all that was left was his $100 suit. Under the deadly silence that reigned in the Senate, the man strode leisurely to the podium, his every step echoing loudly. Standing behind it, he carefully looked around dumbfounded by the piercing gaze of his golden eyes. Most of the people remained seated in a stupor, unable to look away, but the more strong-willed members of the Senate nevertheless overcame their compulsion and looked away sharply. A thin smile appeared on the Roman's lips. \n-Others! - the voice of the man-nimbus seemed to sound in their heads, as some of the participants of this event later stated - got to the very soul. - Senators of the United States! I assure you, I am not an enemy, I am not a Communist, I did not come here with fire and sword. But people like Rockwell shouldn't have to live. By getting him out of here, I've made the world a little better. \n-Who the hell are you? - there was a hysterical shriek from Senator McCarthy, who jumped up from his seat. His hands were shaking distinctly. \n-I'm your salvation. For years, humanity has been disconnected-and what has it led to? You had to leave the world you murdered, destroyed. I, in turn, offer you salvation and deliverance. Under the wings of the Imperial Aquila, humanity will be one, nations, races, nationalities will all contribute to building a better future. \n-Sounds like populism, why should we believe you? \n-Well, we shouldn't, - the man with the nimbus agreed, and looked at the U.S. flags hanging right above the podium. - But you will still have a chance to believe in the truth of my words, if, of course, you are wise enough to accept my offer voluntarily. \n-What if we don't? - the senator frowned. \nThe emperor has been waiting for this question.."

    af_uns.3.desc:0 "The meetings of the Royal Council were so boring to both alicorn sisters that both princesses only occasionally nodded gravely at the proposals of high-ranking bureaucrats and aristocrats. Princess Celestia had seen so much in her long life that almost every day for her was a repeat of one that had already passed - practically Groundhog Day! Except this time the council was discussing demands from the new leadership of the United States, as if some emperor from outer space had appeared there with ideas for the domination of the human species. Celestia recalled how, about five hundred years ago, a Yak Khan had invaded her country, with similar rhetoric. And then there were griffins, primordial monsters, demigods, Old Gods and their servants, Sombra, Federalists, abolitionists, theocracyists, communists, democrats, anarchists... Whoever tried to mess with the land of friendship and magic! And to each invader Celestia personally broke a spine, at first together with Luna, later alone. But as time passed, the immortal sun lord grew lazier, shifting her responsibility to protect the state to other ponies, now Twilight... \nThe doors to the throne room shattered, and with a wild yell of \"aye-aye-aye-aaah\" three enormous human men, with minimal clothing but fully covered helmets, flew in. Celestia allowed herself to raise one eyebrow-the last time a mob had broken into her like that was when she'd made a mistake with a love potion when she was young. Luna reacted more vividly, rising from her throne and blowing her horn, glaring angrily at the intruders. \n- M! М! М! - A man with a blade strapped to his wrist said. - My GlOrIoUs Lord, the door is open! \n-Perturabo said to tell you that he would be honored if you would erect a statue of him in the palace of the conquered Xenos, - the man with the armor covering only his pectoral muscles added in a croaky voice. \n- Who is this Perturabo to demand anything of me? - The voice of a newcomer who, unlike his companions, was entirely covered in gold armor and held a flaming sword in his hand. \n\"Maybe this day isn't getting so boring\" - Celestia thought lazily as she took a bite of a banana. \n- Uh, primarch? Your son? - The third companion of the golden man answered confusedly. \n-Never heard of him, Waammudes. Stop making up stories. Besides, we can't deal with statues right now, - he said, pointing his sword toward the Sun Throne. - We have to deal with you horses first. I find it extremely ridiculous that the dominant life-form on this planet has been talking horses. When I was a kid, I wanted a pony. But unfortunately, in my childhood, they had not yet appeared."

But before we lose, I'll send a message to Twilight, and she and her friends will find a way to break your face with the magic power of friendship or something else. I've lived in this world too long to know how the world works. \nWhile Luna and the ministers stared at their princess with goggled eyes, the intruding gold man laughed out loud, slapping the shoulder of his bizzarred comrade standing beside him. \n- Custodisi, did you hear that? - The man wiped away a tear with his power glove. - And these ponies aren't that easy! But no, talking horse, I came here with an offer. \nCelestia raised both eyebrows at once, something that hadn't happened to her in eight hundred years. \n-What good is Harmony if we don't have a giant tank to keep out those who don't want to be friends? Or, like, help us make friends with all our neighbors? - Princess Luna, having probably her tenth cup of tea of the evening, was ranting. \n-Luna, - Celestia made a grudging crack of her tongue. - Violence doesn't make ponies friends. \n-Maybe not with ponies, - the Emperor said suddenly. - But it works well with humans. There are many of my loyal servants who fought against my glorious armies before they were human. Take your bugs, for instance. \n-Changelings, - Luna said. \n-Well, what if I were to send an ambassador to them, asking them to volunteer to join our new alliance? And the ambassador would be accompanied by ten regiments of the Imperial Army? I think they would understand and accept such friendship. \n-Celestia imagined the stern, uniformed men with laser weapons marching through the Changelings lands, and Chrysalis biting a rock in frustration. She liked the idea, the princess smirked. \n-But before you start doing something on the foreign policy front, your country could use a shake-up. As I learned from the CIA documents, you have stagnation going on here, - the Emperor's tone didn't please Luna. \n-Well, what else could it be? That lazy mare has put her royal croup on the Solar Throne and does nothing, - she laughed wryly, glancing askance at her sister."

Perhaps the accountant Gilliman would be a good executioner... \n-You're being deified too?! - Sun princess suddenly burst into action, literally leaping onto the Emperor's lap and nuzzling her face into his nose so that their eyes were separated by a few centimeters. \n- Great me! Finally, someone who understands me. \n-I understand, - the Emperor nodded gravely, pulling away slightly and carefully trying to get the princess's face away from his face. - Those fools were building temples at the cost of a year's budget, justifying everything they did by saying that I wanted them that way. Even though I didn't even know what they were doing there! \n- There! - The alabaster princess squealed happily, not royally at all, which, it should be said, she never does. - I've been trying to get it into their heads that I'm not a goddess and I don't need to kiss my hooves, I don't need churches and temples! I need to be treated like a normal ruler, not a divine creature! \n- And I wouldn't mind a small cult named after myself," -Luna said quietly, but the Emperor heard her. \n- Humans are... Strange creatures. Many of them need idols. As far as I know, there were sects of Lunarians in the former United States who worshipped you, Princess. \nThe expression on Luna's face at that moment could not have been captured in any painting, for the Emperor had provided the proof-a small icon depicting the night princess as Goddess. \n- Why am I here in blue and black stockings? - The embarrassed princess squeezed the words out of her mouth. - Ponies don't wear stockings, they're uncomfortable for us! \nThe Emperor merely shrugged. While Luna continued to stare at her image with interest, Celestia and the Emperor exchanged signatures on a new treaty that would make Equestria an Imperial protectorate, and recognize the ponies as a safe species that the Imperium would allow to exist normally, with only a ban on colonizing other worlds. Well, for a sunny princess who had found a friend and protector, such a price seemed quite acceptable."

    gem.37.desc:0 "Erwin Rommel never thought this day would come: the old soldier, a veteran of the African campaign and the Oder meat grinder who had saved Germany from ruin, was expecting the most extraordinary guests he could imagine. In the living room of his small seaside home, granted to him for his past services, four armchairs stood by the large fireplace, and a tea service - the best he ever had - stood on the table. Hearing the sound of an engine outside, Rommel went over to the table and took a seat in the chair beside the fireplace-the rheumatism was beginning to set in. After a short \"Come in!\" the front door swung open, and Rommel, sitting half-turned to it, could see who came in:\nNaturally, the first to arrive was the Russian Special Forces man, Serpov, who commanded the USSR Special Forces, the man who had outplayed him on his own battlefield; after him came Shepherd, an elderly American who had defeated his colleagues on the Western front by a head. Montgomery was the last man through the door - despite his rather old age, he was quite fresh and quick. Smiling slightly, Rommel gestured to the officers to the table. It was time for the old enemies to reconcile, have tea, and discuss the affairs of the old days - as it was supposed to be in peacetime. After all, there is no greater joy for a soldier than to hear that his worst enemy is now his friend.

    gem.38.desc:0 "The General Staff and Defense Committee are bent over plans and maps of the continent. The changeling threat to Equestria was growing at an incredible rate: military build-ups, ultimatums and territorial expansions, provocations on the border... All of this could be a big problem, but an even bigger problem was Stalliongrad, a rebellious region that had separated from Equestria. Despite the low threat at the moment, they could become a big problem in the future, especially if they attacked at the wrong moment - and according to intelligence, Stalliongrad had plans to attack Equestria. It was necessary to strike preemptively and neutralize the threat... But how exactly to neutralize a threat of that potential?"

In front were Volkswehr soldiers with red armbands on their arms and flags of the new Germany, driving tanks, from which the Nazi crosses had been erased, replacing them with symbols of socialism. Behind the military parade was a parade of the proletariat - workers, collective farmers, scientists, teachers, doctors...The parade was in full swing, and no one paid attention to the strange figure of a pony or a changeling standing in the front row. He nodded slightly, pushed his small suitcase forward, and slowly walked out of the crowd...nnA few minutes later, as the Changeling soldiers walked past the bleachers, there was a loud explosion, followed by several more. People, changlings and ponies all scattered in a hue and cry, but the military police and medics, on the other hand, rushed to the bleachers to tend to their wounded..."

While waiting for the arrival of the Equestrian delegation, the Kaiser had time to hand out orders and accept courier letters. Several hours seemed to pass when a chariot pulled by a pair of Pegasi, with Princess Celestia herself, her sister Princess Luna, and Princess Twilight seated in it, finally appeared in the sky. After the chariot stopped, the princesses left the chariot and stepped forward. Following the rules of etiquette, Kaiser bowed to the rulers of Equestria, and after receiving a return bow, he spoke:\n-Greetings, your highnesses! I thank you for responding to my letter and coming in person to deliver the shipment. We had planned to take care of this matter ourselves, but we thought it best to send her to you, you know what to do with her. A group of armored men ran up to the truck, and while a couple of them held the truck at gunpoint, the rest dragged the kicking and kicking queen, the Queen Chrysalis herself, out of the truck!\n-Wretched creatures! When I get out, I'm going to destroy you all! - the queen screamed.\n-Herr Kaiser, sir, may I? - Soldier asked, and on receiving an affirmative nod, one of the soldiers took a rag out of his pocket and gagged Chrysalis, sending a wry grin across Twilight's face and a chuckle from Luna.\n-Thank you, sir, - replied Celestia, - we'll begin neutralizing the threat immediately.\nWith that, Celestia's horn was ignited, and Chrysalis was covered in stone in a matter of seconds. After loading the resulting statue onto the chariot, Celestia continued, \n-I hope to continue our productive cooperation in the future!"

    gem_neworder.1.desc:0 "The German General Staff was in a state of complete anarchy: every single German plan broke down one by one. Despite the eastern front, the Empire was able to hold its ground in the southwest and strengthen itself... But the German troops began to feel the effects of the resistance: the undermining of supply echelons, the undermining of the military industry, the theft of food and guerrilla movements were bleeding the army. It seemed that Germany was in for another inferno on the Eastern Front when suddenly a sentry peeked into the staff tent:\n-Herr General! The ambassador from Griffenheim is here to see you.\Nearly surprised, the officers looked at the commander-in-chief, who, after a brief hesitation, invited the ambassador inside, having previously closed all offensive plans. A griffon in plain clothes, with a medal on his chest, entered the room. With a crooked smile, he spoke:\n-My name is Herbert Kruegger, and I carry the will of the Emperor of the great Griffon Empire! Our Emperor recognizes and acknowledges your military prowess and military might, but we have noticed that your advance has slowed. We assume this is due to the actions of the resistance. Therefore, we offer you the following solution:\nFrom his shoulder pouch, the ambassador took out a scroll, unfolded it, and coughed and began to read loudly:\n-We, Emperor of all Gryphonia, [GRI.GetLeader], hereby notify the government of Great Germany of our intention to make peace. With this letter we express our deepest respect for your strategists, and wish to have an ally like you rather than an opponent. The Empire understands and accepts your claim to the lands formerly subject to the Kingdom of Equestria, as well as to the lands of the continent of Equus and the lands of New Mairland, including the British Isle. We, the Emperor of all Gryphonia, [GRI.GetLeader], now enter into a non-aggression pact with Great Germany and pledge not to meddle in the affairs of the German sphere of influence, in return for a promise not to meddle in the affairs of Gryphonia. \Sincerely, [GRI.GetLeader], Emperor of all Gryphonia...Finished reading, the Ambassador cleared his beak and continued, "I understand that you need time to contact your government and everything, so I'll wait outside..."

In contrast, the general and the head of the CIA, who sat across from him, knew exactly why the U.S. Security Council had been convened today...Talks died down, and everyone in the room jumped from their seats when John F. Kennedy entered the room. After the president greeted them all and took his seat, there was silence in the room. Finally, with a sigh, the president began to speak:\n-Dear members of the Security Council! I gathered you all here for a very, very unpleasant reason. As you all know, when we first encountered the locals, their ruler, Princess Celestia, told us that this was a world of friendship and love. However, the information we received from the CIA... Mr. Johnson -the president turned to the head of the CIA -you have the floor. \n-So far, we have recorded more than a dozen local military conflicts, several revolutions and coups. All sorts of paramilitary organizations have stepped up, and bad news is coming from the north of Griffonia. In general terms, this is far from a world of friendship. So we need to take some urgent action. \n-Thank you, Mr. Johnson. As you can see, I can't just order the whole country to get ready for war. Besides, we're Americans! We don't run in fear of wars, we win them! So I have made the following decision. General Shepherd! Mr. Johnson! As the President of the United States of America, I hereby declare the creation of an organization whose responsibility will be to maintain order in the world. I ask you to stand at the head of this organization. I give you carte blanche for anything, as long as it serves the good of the United States.\nAfter these words, Kennedy rose from his chair and slowly walked to the window. He looked to the south, to where the sea was blue in the distance. \n-Let me congratulate you. Today, we begin to make this world a better place.
