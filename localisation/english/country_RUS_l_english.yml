 RUS_guard_motor_rifle_desc:0 "There is no army without the soldiers, and the motorised riflemen are some of the best the Red Army has to offer; they're the first units to enter into the bloody fields of war.

 RUS_multi_AA:0 "Layered Air Defence"
 RUS_multi_AA_desc:0 "Our air defense system was strong enough to resist NATO Air superiority, and many can say that our anti air defence was one of the best.

 RUS_naval_patrol_aircraft:0 "Maritime Patrol Aircraft"
 RUS_naval_patrol_aircraft_desc:0 "Many people don't realize just how important coastal surveillance is, especially in this new world where pirates still seem very abundent.

 RUS_AA_missiles_focus_desc:0 "Modern air combat is done mostly with long-range missiles, occasionally with cannons or machineguns.

 RUS_Kanin:0 "Kotlin-Class Destroyer"
 RUS_Kanin_desc:0 "A tough and old reliable class of destroyer from 1950's, the Kotlin destroyers will be enough to provide a tough shield of defense around our coast for some years.

 RUS_Kashin:0 "Kashin-Class Destroyer"
 RUS_Kashin_desc:0 "A far more advanced destroyer, but still a bit outdated, this class of destroyer is still decades ahead of anything the natives can produce, and can pack quite a punch.

 RUS_victor_class_submarine_desc:0 "Although rather small, size can be a very manipluative thing. The Victor-class nuclear submarine has shown it's combat effective abilities many times, and while our nation can't really create a nuclear reactor for the submarine at the moment, outfitting them with more traditional methods of power will get these subs out into the ocean and create a serious threat towards any native ship."

 RUS_missile_warfare:0 "Reimplant Missile Warfare"
 RUS_missile_warfare_desc:0 "At last, we have gathered the materials needed to begin production of anti-ship missiles!

 RUS.23.t:0 "Volunteering"
 RUS.23.d:0 "Accommodating the Deer of Olenia into Soviet society, has had the rather unexpected effect of bringing the Deer closer to our people. There are actually already some volunteers for our armed forces! It was quite a shocker when our recruiting office recieved several recruitment requests from the first few Deer who wanted to incooperate themselves into the Red Army. \nBetter yet, we actually have two promising Deer officers that recently finished their course at boot camp. We taught them everything we knew, and they actually taught us a lot about themselves, and how we could take the best advantages over the abilities they uniquely possess. \nThis is a great news and a great day for the Soviet Union! This really shows that humanity can integrate in this world with the natives."

We should continue our exploration in this direction...and just hope it's a small bushfire."

 RUS.102.t:0 "First Contact"
 RUS.102.d:0 "‘General Secretary! Our scouts have made contact with sentient natives!’\n\nSome minutes before, the scouting party that was sent to the southwest arrived in front of a village. The BTR-40 and the BMP-1 stopped near the first houses, as the soldiers cautiously dismounted from their large vehicles and observed and analyzed the village. That was until a single creature exited out of one of the houses. It was a deer... or something that looked very similar. It wasn't long before the deer appeared to panic at the sight of the strange looking soldiers and the large vehicles, and called out to the other villagers in a language that sounded shockingly like Finnish. Hearing the panicked voice of the deer, more deer-like creatures appeared from out of their houses and other parts of the village. Wanting to show no ill intentions towards these clearly intelligent deer, the officer in charge of the scouting party ordered everyone to lower their weapons and to keep them down, although many of the scouts had already lowered their weapons. After doing his best to defuse the confusing and fearful atmosphere, the officer in charge ordered the others to relay this information to the government. \n\nThey had made contact with an alien species."

Many of my people have come to regard you as close friends and comrades, and this embassy established by hand and hoof will stand as a monument to our ever expanding friendship." The crowd soon erupted into cheers at the conclusion of Gorbachev's speech. \nIf some Olenian representant didn’t want to talk about it, they are many Olenians who see this embassy as a hope of democracy."

At first, the meeting with the princesses was a little awkward, but the General Secretary was quick to notice this tension and adressed it with the two Princesses. The answer he got was rather unexpected, for it appears that a northern region of Equestria rebelled some years ago, forming its own communist country. \n\nAfter clearing the tension out, and exposing his reformation plans for the Soviet Union to turn it more democratic and free, the situation was appeased between the two parties, and dialoge between the three improved from there. It appeared to have gone greatly, because there is already another meeting organized."

Escorted by some small but intimidating soldiers, our representant met with the Queen of the Changelings, Queen Chrysalis. \nWhile she did not seem aggressive nor menaced us directly, our diplomat said he felt uneased in her presence, “there was something off, I don’t know what.” Adding that she clearly declared her hatred toward Equestria fevorously. After a short visit, our representative quickly left the country in a haste."
 RUS.110.a:0 "We need to keep an eye on them"

 RUS.111.t:0 "Contact with Other Humans"
 RUS.111.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Our diplomats have returned with news from the USA and UEN.

Although, giving away more land to these humans would be rather...embarrassing, but not only are they offering us technology, but elite tactical knowledge! From what we know, these humans are rather agressive and territorial, and have thousands of years of brutal warfare under their belts, and tactical knowledge like that would be extremely valuable to us. Plus, we may need help if the Changelings decided to invade Olenia. What's your say?"
 RUS.117.a:0 "This deal suits the needs of both sides, go with it."
 RUS.117.b:0 "No, this territory belongs to us."

 RUS.118.t:0 "Olenia Accepts"
 RUS.118.d:0 "The Olenian authorities have authorised us to take control over the province of what they call the Winter Wyvern Lands. The acquisition of this territory will help us spread out our population over our territories, so that we aren't so densely packed. Now, lets do our part to the Olenians, and send some scientists and officers to Olenia."
 RUS.118.a:0 "Our turn to help them."

 RUS.119.t:0 "Olenia Refuses"
 RUS.119.d:0 "It was a predictable response. We have recieved word that Olenia has refused to give us the region, after all it has been their land for generations, and they aren't going to just give it away to some strangers from another world."
 RUS.119.a:0 "That’s regrettable"

 RUS.200.t:0 "Dealing with the Locals"
 RUS.200.d:0 "Today, General Secretary Gorbachev met with one of the leaders of the countless protests organized by the natives. The mannered yet passionate deer explained to Gorbachev that some people here were not particularly pleased by sight and fact of their little town being invaded by ‘communist from another dimension’, as the deer put it. They think us humans are going to force them to adapt to our way of life and customs.\nWhat are we going to do?"
 RUS.200.a:0 "Respect and leave the locals alone."
 RUS.200.b:0 "We will do what’s necessary for the Soviet people."

 #RUS.201.t:0 "The Exiled Queen."
 #RUS.201.d:0 "Lately a lot of Olenians have come to live within our borders, flooding in almost as if they're refugees. They have managed to explain to our officals, that King Johan forced the legitimate heir to the throne, Queen Velvet, to flee Olenia after he took the throne to feed his lust for power. The country has since then been suffering under tyranny and crippling corruption that has rooted itself deep into the roots of Olenia. Lately however, we have recieved a letter from Queen Velvet herself through very secured means, and the very nicely worded and polite letter is essentially asking if Gorbechev and the Soviet government can give shelter and assistance to the Queen and those close and loyal to her. \n\nWhat is the course of action we should take?"
 #RUS.201.a:0 "We must protect these individuals from this tyrant."
 #RUS.201.b:0 "We can’t afford to get into political conflicts like this, and anger King Johan..."
 #RUS.201.c:0 "Deliver them to Olenian authority."

 RUS.202.t:0 "Citizenship"
 RUS.202.d:0 "For months now, the deer have been demanding more rights as well as citizenship within the Soviet Union, arguing that they deserve the same rights as everyone else, especially since they were here first. They've been here for hundreds of years, and perhaps even thousands, and have built quite a prosperous and advanced civilization, with even some industry. Wouldn't it be wrong to just throw all of that out the window because we just so happened to land here? But what citizen status are we going to give the deer?"
 RUS.202.a:0 "Everyone is equal in the Soviet Union!"
 RUS.202.b:0 "As long as they accept the communist ideology."
 RUS.202.c:0 "Citizenship for animals? What a silly fantasy."

 RUS.203.t:0 "Love"
 RUS.203.d:0 "Even if we knew that there was interspecies relationships between humans and the deer within our country, they were not official and kept in secrecy, because the lovers feared the consequences of such a union. \n\nThat was until a couple decided to make an official annoucement at the town hall, and while there is no law against interspecies couples, they were quick to come under a barrage of negativity, and the couple was violently expulsed. \n\nThis incident is making headlines all over the Soviet Union, and it's now beginning to evolve into a serious political issue, as voices from both sides are rising. \n\nThere are those who want to keep “each species in their quarters” and those who counter by saying “that we can’t intervene in mutual love between two living beings” ... \n\nOur government needs to be clear, and take a position on this issue."
 RUS.203.a:0 "Why should we prevent two people from loving each other?"
 RUS.203.b:0 "The hell? Don’t you think we have more pressing matters?"
 RUS.203.c:0 "A deer and a human together? Absolutely sickening, condem this beastality!"

 RUS.300.d:0 "As the threat of the Changelings arise, the President of the Soviet Union is asking to join our Alliance. Their country is under the direct threat of Chrysalis, what should we do?"

 RUS.300.b:0 "They're on their own"

 RUS.301.t:0 "Equestria Accepts"
 RUS.301.d:0 "Great news coming from Canterlot today! We have offically been integrated into Equestria's alliance! The people of the Soviet Union and Equestria now stand united together as comrades, and together our armies are ready to fight any foes!"
 RUS.301.a:0 "Let’s hope it won’t be necessary"

 RUS.302.t:0 "Equestria Refuses"
 RUS.302.d:0 "Equestria has unfortunately refused our entry in their alliance... We need to seek support elsewhere"
 RUS.302.a:0 "Some friends they are... We're going to have to rely on ourselves"

 RUS.303.t:0 "The Dynasty Wants an Alliance with Us"
 RUS.303.d:0 "The leader of the so called ‘Eurasian Empire’ Tsar Siergiej I, wants to negotiate an alliance with us... the humans are a very militaristic and warmongering species, the reason they're here in the first place is because they destroyed their homeworld in a devestating war. Their army is well equipped, heavily armed, technologically advanced, and have thousands of years of war experience, they could seriously give us a hand in our crusade against Equestria... \nWhat is your decision?"
 RUS.303.a:0 "We will need all the firepower possible"
 RUS.303.b:0 "We don’t need those worms!"

 RUS.304.t:0 "Chrysalis Accepts"
 RUS.304.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned from Vesalipolis with some promising news. Queen Chrysalis has decided to go along with the idea of a joint alliance between them and Eurasia, and has already invited us to the Changeling discussion of their war plans. The Changelings are now allied with us, lets make the best out of this alliance and use it to our advantage."
 RUS.304.a:0 "A thoughtful and wise decision"

 RUS.305.t:0 "Chrysalis Refuses"
 RUS.305.d:0 "Our diplomats that we sent to Vesalipolis have returned to us with some rather...amusing news. Queen Chrysalis laughed off the purposal of an aliiance between our two countries, and returned our offer harshly. How cute."
 RUS.305.a:0 "Silly roach...wrong answer"

 RUS.306.t:0 "Soviet-Stalliongrad Pact"
 RUS.306.d:0 "Our comrades from the west are asking for support in face of the growing threat of the Changelings! \nThey're the only other extremely powerful communist nation on this continent, we can’t leave them alone..."
 RUS.306.a:0 "We shall stand side by side as comrades!"
 RUS.306.b:0 "We can’t help them..."

 RUS.307.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepts"
 RUS.307.d:0 "Our eastern comrades have responded to our purposal to form a socialist alliance, and they have accepted warmheartingly! Our two countries now stand together against a common enemy, and officers from both side are already meeting to discuss and prepare for an eventual war..."
 RUS.307.a:0 "Workers of the world, unite!"

 RUS.308.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"
 RUS.308.d:0 "We have recieved some rather unfortunate news from our comrades in the east. They explained that even in the case of a war, they wouldn't be able to help much, if barely at all. It would just be too complicated for Stalliongrad to help us in the case of war."
 RUS.308.a:0 "They are too far..."

 RUS.309.t:0 "Invitation to the United Nations"
 RUS.309.d:0 "Many thought they wouldn't ever do it, but they did. Several weeks ago, the Soviet Ambassador here in the United States, approached us with the purposal of a 'grand alliance' between us and the Soviet Union, a purposal sent from Gorbachev himself. The leaders of our country have been debating these past few weeks on the Soviet's purposal for an alliance, but with the decades of rivalry and war between our two nations, many leaders have remained stubborn on distancing ourselves from the Soviets in this new world. However, many realize that an alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union may be humanity's best chance of survival in this new world. After 70 days of bickering back and forth, we're ready to send the Soviets our answer. What will it be?"
 RUS.309.a:0 "Accept their invitation, together we will secure our future."
 RUS.309.b:0 "Refuse their invitation, those commies will never change."

 RUS.310.t:0 "The United States Joins the United Nations"
 RUS.310.d:0 "We have recieved some absolutely outstanding news from New Washington! Our ambassador has relyed the Americans response to our purposal, and the Americans have accepted our proposal to join our grand alliance! Today marks a new day for humanity and our future!"
 RUS.310.a:0 "Welcome to the alliance, old friend."

 RUS.311.t:0 "The United States Declines the Offer"
 RUS.311.d:0 "This morning, we recieved a phone call from our ambassador in the United States, and he unfortunately had to deliver us some regretful news. The Americans have refused the proposal to join our alliance. Maybe we can try again some other day, but for now, the United States isn't ready to put aside the past."
 RUS.311.a:0 "So much for building bridges..."

 RUS.312.t:0 "Invitation to the United Nations"
 RUS.312.d:0 "We've been in contact with the Soviet Union for quite some time now, and we've had the opportunity to warm up to them a lot,(Or for Eastern Europe, warm back up to them) especially with Gorbachev at the helm. However, the day we were all expecting came, with the Soviet Ambassador informing us that the Soviet Union wanted to form a 'grand alliance' with Europe and her nations. Many of our leaders realize the good that can come from an alliance with the Soviets, especially for the good of humanity, and many Western European leaders have warmed up to this idea now that Gorbachev has been enacting his democratic reforms. But their are still many Europeans that don't trust the Soviets, and fear a communist takeover. But what shall our answer be to the Soviets? They're expecting it today."
 RUS.312.a:0 "Accept, only a united Europe will guide humanity to prosperity."
 RUS.312.b:0 "Refuse, we can never trust the Russians."

 RUS.313.t:0 "The Union of European Nations Joins the United Nations"
 RUS.313.d:0 "We have recieved some great news from our ambassador in Europe! After meeting with the European Council, almost every nation agreed to enter into an alliance with the Soviet Union expect for a few, but the general consensus of the council was to accepted our proposal to join the alliance! This is a historic day for not only Russia, but for all of Europe, because for the first time every European stands united against a common foe!"
 RUS.313.a:0 "Greetings, comrades!"

 RUS.314.t:0 "The Union of European Nations Declines the Offer"
 RUS.314.d:0 "Our ambassador has unfortunately had to inform us of some regretful news. The purposal for an alliance with the Soviet Union went to the council today, and it seems a majority of the nations voted not to enter into an aliiance with us. The general consensus of the council was to decline our alliance proposal. It appears that once again, Russia stands alone against our enemies."
 RUS.314.a:0 "What happened to being in this together...?"

 RUS.402.d:0 "From the revolution of 1917, the valiant defence of 1941... to the bloody fighting in Afghanistan and finally the war of 1983...\nThe red army stood. Not always the best in the field, nor the best trained, or equipped. But the Red Army soldier stood.\nHe knew what was behind him and he will continue to serve our nation.\n\nLong live The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army!"
 RUS.402.a:0 "Ura!"

 RUS.405.d:0 "The Soviets have approached us with a particular proposal.\nThey would propose to unite our country, to stand a better chance against the Changeling Lands if war comes to us.\n\nWhile it will be a great administrative challenge, it will give us a better chance to save our country."
 RUS.405.a:0 "Agreed."
 RUS.405.b:0 "No way."

 RUS.406.t:0 "The Olenians Accepted!"
 RUS.406.d:0 "The Olenians have accepted our proposals!\n\nFrom both side, politicians and administration staff are already working to the make the finishing touches of our union.\nWhile it's not perfect it will give us a better chance to survive in this hostile world."

 RUS.408.t:0 "New Capital City?"
 RUS.408.d:0 "While our country is adapting to its new society, we must choose a capital for It. The two old capitals of both countries are candidates and (obviously) both sides want theirs to be chosen.\n\nHjortland is an old city. It’s a pretty city that has been home of the Deer for generations.\nNew Moscow on the other hand is a very powerful city, economically wise.\n\nWhatever we shall choose will probably bother the other side. What city should we choose?"
 RUS.408.a:0 "Hjortland, home of the Deers"

 RUS.4010.b:0 "Infrastructure will help our reconstruction."

 RUS.4020.t:0 "Fast or Cautious?"
 RUS.4020.d:0 "Considering the danger of this world, our reconstruction is taking quite some time. Should we accelerate?\n\nIt might come at the cost of building safety.\nBut if we need to rebuild our country rapidly, maybe quantity will be better than quality"
 RUS.4020.a:0 "We have no time to be cautious."
 RUS.4020.b:0 "Maybe we can take a second glance at those blueprints."

 RUS.4030.t:0 "Clearing Forest"
 RUS.4030.d:0 "We ran into a small issue for our plans of reconstruction, especially in the north of the country.\n\nThe Neighbouring Bluebird Forest is a godsend for our industry in that we can build quality prefab homes rapidly thanks to the high quality lumber available.\nAlso, we can clear a lot of the area for our cities to expand.\n\nThe problem concerns the locals tolerating us cutting down the forest considering our situation. There has been friction between some locals and the forest industry about parts of the forest considered sacred in folklore.\nThe deer have offered their assistance to help our lumberjacks leave those parts untouched and give us nice information about the essences of trees.\n\nWhat should we do about this issue?"
 RUS.4030.a:0 "Let's concert with the locals."
 RUS.4030.b:0 "Who cares."

 RUS.4040.t:0 "Public Transport"
 RUS.4040.d:0 "Transportation of our population is of vital importance in such limited space.\nOur different ministries have concerns with the task.\n\nThere are plans to build the Svenholm-Kuuvaloranta highway, with several Railways accompanying it, along with a way to travel by boats between the different cities.\n\nWith the task at hand, a handfull of our ministers have considered leaving the job to private companies.\nSome have already given interesting propositions."

 RUS.4060.a:0 "Sounds good."

Maybe it would be time for us to pay them back and protect them from some greedy bastards?"
