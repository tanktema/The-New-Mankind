 HUM.1154.d:0 "The Equestrian government has offered a military alliance in the face of the danger of this world. \n\nThe council is divided on this question. It goes against our policy of neutrality, but at the same time many see this as a possibility to defend ourselves much more effectively."

 HUM.1154.b:0 "Meh."


 HUM.116.t:0 "Griffon Treatment"
 HUM.116.d:0 "The United State treatment of griffon minorities has sparked quite a debate in our society. \nWhile our minorities are underrepresented, the Americans have granted them a lot of liberties under their rule. \n\nAnd now those living inside our border are asking for the same rights!"

 HUM.120.a:0 "Good."

 HUM.121.t:0 "Declare War on the USSR?"
 HUM.121.d:0 "Until now the human country known as the Soviet Union has stayed out of our way. But having this nation exist is asking for trouble, as they might join the war when we are halfway through Equestria. \nThis could be a devastating blow for us.\n\nA good part of our general staff consider we should attack them as soon as we are ready."
 HUM.121.a:0 "Get rid of them."
 HUM.121.b:0 "Not now."

 HUM.122.t:0 "New Planes"
 HUM.122.d:0 "Our design bureau, thanks to our new blueprint “acquired” from the humans, have made several proposals to upgrade our planes to a new standard. \n\nThey are also developing new, more powerful weapons for our aircraft. \nWith this, we should have a better chance against human aircraft in battle."
 HUM.122.a:0 "Good."


 HUM.200.t:0 "Crystal Ponies Relief Operation"
 HUM.200.d:0 "The news of the human’s arrival and their desperate situation have provoked a wave of emotion in our country. \n\nA feeling of a sympathy with the Human’s situation. \nThere are already a lot of ponies sending care packages to the humans of the Soviet Union and Europe.\n\nOther, more motivated individuals have been forming Relief groups and are departing to the USSR and UEN to help those countries install themselves in this new world."
 HUM.200.a:0 "Good luck to them!"

 HUM.201.t:0 "Crystal Ponies Relief Operation"
 HUM.201.d:0 "The Crystal Ponies, moved by our situation, have decided to step in and intervene immediately to help us.\nThousands of packages and hundreds of volunteer relief workers came to help us. \n\nIt’s a surprise for many of us, but we can only be thankful that they have intervened to help us in our situation."
 HUM.201.a:0 "This was unexpected"

 HUM.202.t:0 "UEN-Crystal Meeting"
 HUM.202.d:0 "This is the first official meeting between Europeans and Crystal Ponies. The humans have already know the Crystal Empire's kindness in the past, when some years ago some inhabitants of the empire left to help an unknown species in their time of need.\nThe citizen of the UEN haven't forget and nowadays its not rare to see references to the Crystal Empire in the country such as “Streets of the Volunteer”, and “Mi Amore Cadenza Plaza”. There has also been talk to name a ship in honor of them.\n\nSo it’s only normal that the Europeans met with their saviors when they could, with some presents of course. Outside of a new car, fresh out of the factory for the royal family, the European council has offered a great deal for the Crystal Empire and its industry. Unbeatable deal between the two countries in commercial exchange.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, the Europeans have declared they would intervene immediately if the Empire came under attack.\nThe rest of the “meeting” was just a great party in the Crystal City. The officials of both countries also invited diplomats from the embassy to join in, most notably the Soviet ambassador and a representant of Stalliongrad.\n\nUEN military units were also present. A guard unit performed a drill before a large crowd and an aerobatics team on SK-60 flew above the city.\n\nA great bond between our two nations has been created. There’s no doubt further deals will be done between us."
 HUM.202.a:0 "Good fun"
 HUM.202.b:0 "Good fun"

 HUM.203.t:0 "UEN-Crystal Meeting"
 HUM.203.d:0 "As the UEN and Crystal Empire celebrate their friendship, they decided to invite different ambassadors including our representant in Crystal City. Both the UEN and Crystal Empire have decided to increased their relations and economic partnership.\n\nOur ambassador has also informed us that the Crystal Empire has sent some presents to our government."
 HUM.203.a:0 "We remember their help in our time of need."
