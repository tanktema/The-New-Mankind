FAC_MILITARY_main_info:0 "§Bbasic information: §!At all times, the army, guards and gendarmerie have played a huge role in maintaining order and maintaining the regime, but the security structures are not always allies of the government, they often defend their interests and can stab the ruling elite in the back, not to mention ordinary residents whom they now vow to protect. Legal access to weapons makes an open confrontation with them pointless, but they will not be able to do anything in the event of a major scandal. The security forces are a powerful faction with which alliances can significantly strengthen our state, but there is no guarantee that in one of their secret games they will not decide to remove you from the board."
FAC_MIL_ALERT_BUTTON:0 "Extreme measures" 
FAC_MIL_ALERT_TOOLTIP:0 "Throw all available forces to fight this faction. The button will be available if the influence of the faction is above 6000 points"

FAC_MIL_NARKOTA_TOOLTIP:0 "Conduct a major investigation into senior officers and falsify evidence. The success rate for this solution is §G75%. §!If successful, faction influence and approval will drop by §Yx§! And §Ry%§! respectively. If you fail, you will lose §Gz§! Political power, §G3%§! Stability and §Ry%§! Approval of the security forces."
FAC_MIL_BANDOSY_TOOLTIP:0 "Sponsor a terrorist attack in a major city with a §G **% § chance of success! If everyone becomes aware of the government's involvement in the terrorist attack, this will significantly shake your positions, the popularity of the ruling party will fall by §R5%,§! stability by §R3%,§! and government influence on §R 900§! units. If successful, the police influence will drop by §G 1200§! units."

FAC_GOV_methods_info:0 "§YMethods: §!bribery, propaganda, manipulation of budgetary funds."
FAC_GOV_main_info:0 "§BMain information: §!Whatever you think, the government is not you, not your puppet, or even your friend. The government does not care deeply about the immorality of their actions, the deputies are ready to go to any meanness to maintain their power and you will not always meet their expectations. But at the same time, the government cannot be considered an enemy either; after all, it is the basis of the regime. Fight the government or maintain good relations - the choice is yours."

The fight against trade unions can be carried out through propaganda stories in the media, demonstration trials or provocations during a rally. This faction can become your best friend, but it is worth making sure that it does not gain too much power and does not get out of control, as this could threaten you with a regime change."
FAC_MID_main_info:0 "§BMain information: §!Intelligency is a versatile concept, but for the state it is primarily good managers, as well as scientists. The intelligency usually owns their own small businesses, local shops, establishments, hospitals, laboratories, and so on. Their main methods of struggle are strikes, bribery of officials and recruiting supporters among ordinary pony, which allows them at some point to turn the proletarian against the government, however, the proletarian can go against them, and then the intelligency has to cooperate with law enforcement agencies. Despite all the bad things, they can do a lot for your regime."
