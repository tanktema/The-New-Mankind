# First of all, you need to create folders named "common" and "gfx"
# in the "common" folder you have to create folder "on_actions" and put thhis file into it
# in the folder "gfx" you need to create folder "leaders", then open it and create folder wit USSR tag (SOV) and put generals photos in it

					traits = {  } #in the gabs put names of generals traits. You can find them in game or mod folder, Check common/unit_leader/00_traits.txt or 01_traits.txt. You must not use traits with type "field_marshal"
